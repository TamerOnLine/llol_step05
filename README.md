# Step 04 – Dynamic Translation Integration

This step represents a major breakthrough in building a multilingual-ready resume management system using Flask and Babel.

Instead of relying on hardcoded translations, we now support **fully dynamic translation** of user-generated content, UI text, and database fields – including RTL support for Arabic.

---

## ✅ Key Accomplishments

- Implemented dynamic translation fields (e.g. `title_translations`, `value_translations`)
- Applied `force_locale(get_locale())` to enforce active language in UI rendering
- Enabled flash message translations with context-aware control
- Added `dir="rtl"` support for Arabic in the HTML layout
- Activated session-based language switching across all admin routes and templates

## 🧠 Why There Is No Manual Translation Here

> This project does **not** rely on manually written dual-language documentation.  
> All translatable elements are rendered **dynamically** based on the active language selected by the user.

🌐 Instead of duplicating content in this README file, the system itself showcases how multilingual rendering works – live and in real time.

## 🌍 Try It Yourself

To experience dynamic translation in action, simply run the app and switch languages via the admin panel or by using URL parameters like:

```
/admin/resume_builder?lang=ar
/admin/resume_builder?lang=en
```

The content will be automatically rendered in the selected language, including layout direction.
